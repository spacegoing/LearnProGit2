    git commit --amend
    This option is used when:
    Commit too early that some files forgot to add
    Commit message was wrong.
    
    For the first case:
    git commit "The previous one" 
    git add the-file-you-forgot
    git commit --amend "Overwrite the last commit"

  + Undo staging area: git reset
    git reset HEAD [filename]
    
    This command only touch the staging area. It will unstage the staged files.

  + Undo modified files:
    git checkout -- [filename]
    
    This command is dangerous. You're overwriting the current file with file from last
    commit. Every change will lose. A better way to do this is using branch.
